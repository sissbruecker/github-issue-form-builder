# Github Issue Form Builder

A visual editor for Github issue form templates ([more information here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms)).
Allows to configure fields such as inputs, text areas, or checkboxes, and shows a preview of how the resulting form will look. Then creates a template configuration file that you can configure in your Github repository.
